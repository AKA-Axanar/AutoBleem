; ========================
; SDLPoP mod configuration
; ========================

; This is an example configuration file for custom levelsets loaded with SDLPoP.

; To use, place a copy of this file in the mod's directory ("mods/Your Mod Name/").
; For general information on how you can use mods with SDLPoP, see Readme.txt.

; Lines starting with a semicolon (";") are comment lines and are ignored by SDLPoP.
; They are used to document the available customization options.

; "default" is a valid setting for any option.

; NOTE: In this example file, the available options were all disabled, so they do not
;       immediately replace the settings in SDLPoP.ini.
;       To re-enable an option, simply delete the semicolon in front of that option.


[General]
;enable_copyprot = false

[AdditionalFeatures]
;enable_quicksave = true

[Enhancements]
;use_fixes_and_enhancements = false

;    'prompt' --> the game will ask each time the game is launched (Default)
;    'true'   --> fixes and enhancements are used
;    'false'  --> fixes and enhancements are not used
;
; Below, you can pick which fixes/enhancements will be active:

; Adds a way to crouch immediately after climbing up: press down and forward simultaneously.
; In the original game, this could not be done (pressing down always causes the kid to climb down).
;enable_crouch_after_climbing = true

; Time runs out while the level ending music plays; however, the music can be skipped by disabling sound.
; This option stops time while the ending music is playing (so there is no need to disable sound).
;enable_freeze_time_during_end_music = true

; Enable guard hitpoints not resetting to their default (maximum) value when re-entering the room.
;enable_remember_guard_hp = true

; If a room is linked to itself on the left, the closing sounds of the gates in that room can't be heard.
;fix_gate_sounds = true

; An open gate or chomper may enable the Kid to go through walls. (Trick 7, 37, 62)
;fix_two_coll_bug = true

; If a room is linked to itself at the bottom, and the Kid's column has no floors, the game hangs.
;fix_infinite_down_bug = true

; When a gate is under another gate, the top of the bottom gate is not visible.
;fix_gate_drawing_bug = true

; When climbing up to a floor with a big pillar top behind, turned right, Kid sees through floor.
; The current fix causes glitches you can see on bug_chomper.PNG and bug_climb.PNG .
;fix_bigpillar_climb = false

; When climbing up two floors, turning around and jumping upward, the kid falls down.
; This fix makes the workaround of Trick 25 unnecessary.
;fix_jump_distance_at_edge = true

; When climbing to a higher floor, the game unnecessarily checks how far away the edge below is;
; This contributes to sometimes "teleporting" considerable distances when climbing from firm ground.
;fix_edge_distance_check_when_climbing = true

; Falling from a great height directly on top of guards does not hurt.
;fix_painless_fall_on_guard = true

; Bumping against a wall may cause a loose floor below to drop, even though it has not been touched. (Trick 18, 34)
;fix_wall_bump_triggers_tile_below = true

; When pressing a loose tile, you can temporarily stand on thin air by standing up from crouching.
;fix_stand_on_thin_air = true

; Buttons directly to the right of gates can be pressed even though the gate is closed (Trick 1)
;fix_press_through_closed_gates = true

; By jumping and bumping into a wall, you can sometimes grab a ledge two stories down (which should not be possible).
;fix_grab_falling_speed = true

; When chomped, skeletons cause the chomper to become bloody even though skeletons do not have blood.
;fix_skeleton_chomper_blood = true

; Controls do not get released properly when drinking a potion, sometimes causing unintended movements.
;fix_move_after_drink = true

; A drawing bug occurs when a loose tile is placed to the left of a potion (or sword).
;fix_loose_left_of_potion = true

; Guards may "follow" the kid to the room on the left or right, even though there is a closed gate in between.
;fix_guard_following_through_closed_gates = true

; When landing on the edge of a spikes tile, it is considered safe. (Trick 65)
;fix_safe_landing_on_spikes = true

; The kid may glide through walls after turning around while running (especially when weightless).
;fix_glide_through_wall = true

; The kid can drop down through a closed gate, when there is a tapestry (doortop) above the gate.
;fix_drop_through_tapestry = true

; When dropping down and landing right in front of a wall, the entire landing animation should normally play.
; However, when falling against a closed gate or a tapestry(+floor) tile, the animation aborts.
; (The game considers these tiles floor tiles; so it mistakenly assumes that no x-position adjustment is needed)
;fix_land_against_gate_or_tapestry = true

; Sometimes, the kid may automatically strike immediately after drawing the sword.
; This especially happens when dropping down from a higher floor and then turning towards the opponent.
;fix_unintended_sword_strike = true

; By repeatedly pressing 'back' in a swordfight, you can retreat out of a room without the room changing. (Trick 35)
;fix_retreat_without_leaving_room = true

; The kid can jump through a tapestry with a running jump to the left, if there is a floor above it.
;fix_running_jump_through_tapestry = true

; Guards can be pushed into walls, because the game does not correctly check for walls located behind a guard.
;fix_push_guard_into_wall = true

; By doing a running jump into a wall, you can fall behind a closed gate two floors down. (e.g. skip in Level 7)
;fix_jump_through_wall_above_gate = true

; If you grab a ledge that is one or more floors down, the chompers on that row will not start.
;fix_chompers_not_starting = true

; As soon as a level door has completely opened, the feather fall effect is interrupted because the sound stops.
;fix_feather_interrupted_by_leveldoor = true

; Guards will often not reappear in another room if they have been pushed (partly or entirely) offscreen.
;fix_offscreen_guards_disappearing = true
