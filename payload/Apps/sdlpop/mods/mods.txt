Playing custom levelsets with SDLPoP
====================================

1. Place the folder with the mod's files inside this folder (the "mods/" directory).

2. Make sure that the name of the mod's folder is correct.
   For example: 

   mods/Prince4D/

3. Open SDLPoP.ini and change the value of the 'levelset' option to the name of the mod.
   For example: 

   levelset = Prince4D

4. Save the changes to SDLPoP.ini, launch the game and play!



N.B.: In the mod's directory, only the data files that are different from the original game (V1.0) are needed.
