This app starts BleemSync's (1.2) networking features. It is required to have the bleemsync folder on the root of the USB drive.

If all is well, your network adapter should be initalized and have an IP within 15 seconds of launch. If not, refer to logs\network.log

Some chipsets may additionally require the BleemSync kernel be installed to function properly.

Basic instructions (if you have not used BleemSync networking before):
1. Ensure your wireless adapter is compatible (refer to ModMyClassic)
2. Create a file called ssid.cfg in: bleemsync\etc\bleemsync\CFG\
3. Open the file in a text editor and type two lines, the first containing your network's SSID and the second your network's password, e.g.:
MyAwesomeWiFiAP
SuperSecretPassword

Refer to ModMyClassic for additional information about networking, including alternate setup instructions or details about supported USB network adapters.
