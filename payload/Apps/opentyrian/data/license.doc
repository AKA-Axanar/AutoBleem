the date of commencement of this Agreement (referred to as the Warranty
Period), be free from defects in material and workmanship.  Epic further
warrants, for your benefit alone, that during the Warranty Period the

replacement or, if so elected by Epic, refund of amounts paid by you
under this Agreement.  You agree that the foregoing constitutes your
sole and exclusive remedy for breach by Epic of any warranties made under

FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTY THAT THE GAME WILL FUNCTION IN
CONJUNCTION WITH OR ON ANY COMPUTER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE NOT EXPRESSLY
SUPPORTED BY THE GAME AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT FIRST BECOMES EFFECTIVE.

8.  Limitation of Liability.  Epic's cumulative liability to you or any
other party for any loss or damages resulting from any claims, demands,
or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall not exceed
the license fee paid to Epic for the use of the Game.  In no event shall
Epic be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or
exemplary damages or lost profits, even if Epic has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

9.  Trademark.  The names Epic and Epic MegaGames, as well as the names
of the Game or Games licensed hereunder, are valuable registered and/or

this Agreement against the other party regarding the subject matter hereof,

hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any
breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to
subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of
future breaches.

between the parties.  This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
in a writing signed by you and Epic.
