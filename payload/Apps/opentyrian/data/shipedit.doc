Ё  Introduction           Ё
юддддддддддддддддддддддддды

ShipEdit is a fairly straightforward program [aside from the graphical editor]
and can be used to add your own customized ships to the game.  It is specially
designed so it is difficult to cheat, but you can make sure you use any weapon
you want while playing the game.

Different Tyrian Versions:

     ShipEdit will automatically detect whether you are using version 1.0/1.1
or the new version 2.0.  I would suggest using version 2.0, but this program
does have automatic backward compatibility when compiling.  It will show
in the editor screen what version you are using.
[0-1 is version 1.0 or 1.1 - ShipEdit cannot discern between them.
   2 is version 2.0]

USER.SHP
        This is the user data file.  This file contains the current editor data
        used by ShipEdit, including all the ship graphics you have drawn, the
        ship weapon data, etc.

USER2.SHP & USER3.SHP
        Two additional data files included with ShipEdit.  Each contains 8
        different sets of graphics from Tyrian that can be used as ships.  To
        use one of these files, simply rename it to be USER.SHP.

NEWSH$.SHP
        This is the compiled data file which is used by Tyrian.  ShipEdit
        automatically saves your data and compiles it when you exit the
        program.  This file is version-specific!


Giving Custom Ships to Other People:

     There are two ways to give data you have edited to other people.

     (1) Give them your editor data - USER.SHP.  If they have ShipEdit, they
         can edit this file and compile it for use with their version of
         Tyrian.  (To compile it, just run ShipEdit and then exit the program.)

         Note that if they enter the ship data editor, ShipEdit will change
         the data presented if they do not have access to those weapons.
         (See Below under the section SHIP DATA for more information.)

     (2) Give them your compiled data file NEWSH$.SHP.  This is
         version-specific but they do not need ShipEdit to use it.  I would
         suggest limiting uploads of this file to those compiled under version
         2.0 to avoid future problems - or at least to clearly mark what
         version you intend this for.  Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are interchangeable
         but 2.0 uses a different format.

Ё Using a NEWSH$.SHP file Ё     
юддддддддддддддддддддддддды

Tyrian will automatically find a NEWSH$.SHP file, check for how much memory
it requires, and load it into your game.

To activate one of the ten available ships while playing:

Player 1:  Hold down  TAB and press a number from 1 through 0    [0=Ship #10]
Player 2:  Hold down CAPS and press a number from 1 through 0

NEWSH$.SHP contains the graphics for your custom ships.  If you change the
graphics in this file, your saved games will use the new graphics.  Just make
sure you don't delete this file after you've started using them.

For example, if I pressed TAB+5, I would activate my custom ship #5.  This
might be using graphic set #3, which is a snowball.  If I changed the ship
graphic to a bubble in the editor and then ran Tyrian again, this ship would
no longer be a snowball, but would use the bubble graphics.

Ё Ship Data               Ё
юддддддддддддддддддддддддды

There are 10 fields for each ship.  There are 10 sets of ship data you can
use at one time.

[NOTE: The Street-Fighter-Like commands (or "twiddles", as one person so oddly
put it) will not work for custom ships that you design.  It's the price you
pay, though I may alter it someday if I find an easy workaround.]


SHIP #:        This is the ship slot you are currently editing.  At the bottom
               of the screen you are shown how to activate this ship while
               playing the game.

Ship Graphic:  This is the graphic your ship will use.  You may select from
               just about any of the graphics available in the game, and can
               choose from any of the eight custom sets of graphics.

               Choose the items this ship configuration will use:
Front Weapon:    [*]
Rear Weapon:     [*]
Special Weapon:  [*]
Left Sidekick:   [*]
Right Sidekick:  [*]   [**]
Power:          [***]
Armor:          [***]
Shield:         [***]

[*]  - The game will keep track of every weapon you have found.  Aside from a
       basic available selection, you can only choose those weapons that you
       have found.

[**] - There are cetain sidekicks available in Version 2.0 which should only
       be used as RIGHT sidekicks.  They probably won't crash the game, but
       if selected as a left sidekick will not look very nice.  These are
       labeled in the editor as [RIGHT ONLY].

[***]- The more you play the game, the better the class of items you can
       select.  Also, this will improve faster if you get good destruction
       percentage scores.  Good luck!

Ё Graphical Editor        Ё
юддддддддддддддддддддддддды

As you can see by the example files, User1 and User2, there are 8 banks of
ships which are labeled within the editor.  There are five turning frames
for each ship, from left to right:

#1 - Hard left turn
#2 - Beginning left turn
#3 - Center
#4 - Beginning right turn
#5 - Hard right turn

You CAN use the available graphical tools, but they are keyboard-based and
are cumbersome to use except for slight touch-ups or applying certain
specific alterations.  The commands are shown onscreen in the help boxes if
you need to use them.

I would suggest using an independent program to create your own PCX screens
and to load in ships from there.  Keep in mind that you can use SHIPEDIT.PCX
to get the palette you need to use, or you can simply capture the editor
screen.

To capture a shape from a PCX screen, move to the ship frame you want to
edit and press 'E'.  This will activate the editor for this shape.  Now, press
'E' again to bring up a list of PCX files in the current directory.

Select the PCX file to capture from by pressing the first letter of the
image name and/or using the arrow keys.  Then, press ENTER.  [ESC will exit
this screen.]

Now, the image will be displayed onscreen and a flashing rectangle will also
appear.  Use your mouse to position the rectangle around the shape you want
to capture and press button 1.  [ESC will also exit this screen.]

To capture another frame from the same file, all you need to do is move to the
next frame you want to capture and press 'L'.

Keep in mind that Color #0 is transparent!  We don't want to have you flying
around in a black rectangle, now, do we?

Yes, ShipEdit will load the Tyrian music data and attempt to play it.  It may
or may not work with MIDI very well, but does use the same driver as Tyrian,
so there should be no problems.

There is another Jukebox in this version, an earlier one we didn't release,
which is quite insane and should definitely confound you.

The Jukebox manual follows:

Ё Basic-User's Commands   цбдыю©
юдддддддддддддддддддддддддааддды

The left and right arrow keys change the song selection on the jukebox front.

V - Toggles between Tempo and Volume control.  Tempo is blue.  Volume is yellow.

The up and down arrow keys, in addition to the PGDN and PGUP keys, control
the tempo bars on the bottom left and right of the screen.  The higher it
gets, the faster the song plays.


F - Fades the tempo down to slow.

L - If you have individual DAT files you want to play, this will load them
    from the disk directly.

R - Starts the song over from the beginning again.

T - Resets the tempo to normal.

ESC or Q - Quit the Jukebox

    B     Blanks the screen to color 0   (often referred to as black)

    C     Clears the palette to black

    D     Draws the palette in two horizontal bars at the top-left of the
          screen

    I     Loads a PCX image from disk

    M     Turns off all filters, turns the song name and bars off, and
          sets the program to Ultra-Speed

    P     Creates a dual-color palette
          This palette will fade all 256 colors from one color to another,
          making it look ugly most of the time.
          Keep pressing P until you find two colors you like.

    S     Toggles the song name and tempo bars on and off
          (You won't notice you have turned them off because they'll still
           be on the screen from the last time they were drawn there!)

    U     Reverts to the main palette after you're tired of the palette you
          generated using P

    Z     Toggle Ultra-Speed   (This deactivates the delay and the stars)

    F1    Randomizes the RED values in the palette
    F2    Randomizes the GREEN values in the palette
    F3    Randomizes the BLUE values in the palette
          (Generally, you'll use these commands after pressing C)

 [ and ]  Certain commands below use a variable in the program to modify their
          effect.  The left bracket decreases this effect and the right
          bracket increases it.

 { and }  For a faster way to modify the variable above, use these instead

   1-4    Different fade effects
           1- Vertical+Horizontal fade
           2- Horizontal fade
           3- Vertical fade
           4- Diagonal fade

    5     Ugly fuzzy-plasm grower
           Causes a field of fuzz to grow out of whatever shapes are on the
           screen
           Looks like tree bark under a microscope changing at an impossible
           speed

    6     Fuzz

    7     Random Fuzz

    8     Generic No-frills fuzz
          (Creates absolutely no interesting patterns, guaranteed!)

    9     Wild slow fade towards the bottom-right with a neat lava effect
          growing out of the background after a while.
          This works best with a palette generated by P.

    0     Weird circle thing.
          A large circle creates more and more ripples of itself while
          shrinking.  If it shrinks enough, you get to see duplicates of
          the circle coming onto the screen.  Of course, it doesn't work
          quite the way it originally did, but hey, it's neat.

SHIFT-0   Diamond generator
          Creates odd cross-hatching diamond patterns.  Not as good as my
          Quiltmaster, but oh well.

SHIFT-9   Cross-hatching color cycler
          This works best with P.  It causes a box in the center of the screen
          to cycle along a palette very slowly while introducing a growing
          amount of noise.  It's weird seeing the image in the box fading
          away and then coming back again in another color.
          It reminds me of a stained-glass window.

SHIFT-8   Water rippler
          P produces a nice palette to look at this with.
          The image has a water (or lava) effect placed in the background
          while any shapes on the screen waver in a wild pattern much like
          a real pool of water changes the image reflecting in it when you
          cause the water to run in a river over little rocks.

SHIFT-7   Medium water waves
SHIFT-6   Water waves in almost symmetry
SHIFT-5   Large water waves
SHIFT-4   This one causes shapes on the screen to expand.
          Once the shape expands enough, water waves appear inside it while
          the shape still grows.
          (The water wave effects work best with P or another nice palette
           with few color transitions)

SHIFT-3   Super 9.
          This one fades the screen constantly in a diagonal pattern, and
          like 9, little dots appear in sections that have faded completely.
          However, the dots cause circular ripples to appear overlapping
          each other.  With a little user fiddling, the effect is fantastic.

SHIFT-2   This one causes a normal fade to work on the screen.
          Like 9 and Shift-3, though, little dots can appear on the screen
          as well.
          But, you can control the dots using the left and right brackets
          ( [ and ] ).  The left bracket decreases the rate of dot appearance
          while the right bracket increases the rate.
          The jukebox starts out with the bracket value at 0, meaning there
          are NO dots that appear.


          SUPER-PARALLAXING EFFECTS:

   -      Moderately fast parallax to the right
   _      Moderately fast parallax to the left

   =      Slightly faster parallax to the right
   +      Slightly faster parallax to the left

   ,      Fast, symmetric parallax to the left
   .      Fast, symmetric parallax to the right

   <      Fast, symmetric parallax to the left    *with distortion*
   >      Fast, symmetric parallax to the right   *with distortion*

   ;      Very Fast, symmetric parallax to the left
   '      Very Fast, symmetric parallax to the right

   The Super-Parallaxing effects all function like SHIFT-2 except for
   [<] and [>] which function like SHIFT-3.

   The [-] and [_] commands cannot be combined with other commands, while
   all the other parallax commands can.

SHIFT-1   This function uses the brackets the same way as SHIFT-2.
          However, it parallaxes both left and right at the same time with
          the center standing still!  This is centered perfectly on the
          center of the ECLIPSE logo in ECLIPSE2.PCX.

   F5     Auto-Detailer.
          This effect creates weird details in pictures and generally works
          best on a pre-made image with a well-gradiated palette.

 F6-F8    More Auto-Detailer modes!

SHIFT-F5  Even MORE Auto-Detailer modes!
 through  (SHIFT-F8 is my favorite)
 SHIFT-F8

BACKSPACE Screen-Streaker
          Causes any image on the screen to fade (or slide) downwards.  This
          often leaves large amounts of residue at the top.

ShipEdit is written by the same person who wrote Tyrian [and this manual],
but it is not supported by Epic and is regarded as an independent creation.
It is not specifically supported in any way by anyone, though nice letters to
me on Compuserve might get you an answer. :)

I forsee no problems as long as you keep in mind the version limitations.
For instance, additional items available in version 2.0 will probably crash
someone's copy of version 1.1, so try to indicate what version you intend any
uploads to be used under!

As always, with something as complex as this, there are probably bugs and other
problems.  I've never seen one, but who knows?
