To start Tyrian
---------------

  1. Switch to the drive where the game is installed (C:)
  2. Switch to the subdirectory where the game is installed (CD \TYRIAN)
  3. Before running Tyrian for the first time, you should run SETUP.EXE to
     configure the sound and music settings. 
     
     Note: If you have a Pentium processor, make sure you choose "Pentium"
     in the Detail menu section to get added graphical effects.

  4. After configuring your sound card, exit the setup program, then type
     TYRIAN to begin the game.


=============================================================================
                      Common problems and solutions
=============================================================================

Running with Windows
---------------------

Tyrian's network mode will not work with the Win95 IPX system. Please 
run multiplayer network games in DOS mode with the appropriate DOS 
IPX drivers loaded.

Tyrian does not work reliably under Windows 3.xx with sound on.  Please run
SETUP from DOS and select "No Music" and "No Effects" under setup if you
need to run Tyrian from Windows.  If you still have problems, exit Windows
and run Tyrian from DOS.

Tyrian should work under Windows 95 on most computers.  However, if you
have any problems running under Windows 95, you'll have to run Tyrian from
MS-DOS Mode instead. 

If you are running TYRIAN through Windows, make sure you change the keyboard
configuration in the options menu, so the ALT key will not be used. Windows
has specific uses for the ALT key that may interfere with the game.

Running with OS/2
-----------------

Though Tyrian may work reliably under OS/2 on some computers, we
don't recommend this because it might result in the game locking up.
Please run Tyrian through DOS, instead.


=============================================================================
                      HOW TO BOOT YOUR COMPUTER CLEAN
=============================================================================
			    
If you're having problems running Tyrian, you might be able to get it
up and running by "Booting your computer clean."  By this, we mean starting
your computer without loading all of the memory managers and device drivers
that might interfere with the game.  It's a relatively simple process, so
please bear with us.

If you have DOS 5.0
-------------------

   Please skip this section if you have DOS 6.0 or later!

   You need to create a "boot disk" to allow you to start your computer
   without loading all the TSR's and memory managers that take away 
   memory.  Here's how.

   A. Put a blank disk in your A: drive and format it as a DOS disk.  (Don't
      do this in your B: drive - it won't work!)  To do this, type the
      following command:
      
      FORMAT A: /S

   B.  Wait while your computer formats the disk.
   C.  Label the disk "Boot Disk" and keep it handy.  You'll need this
       disk whenever you want to start TYRIAN.

   Now, you can reboot your computer and play Tyrian:

   A.  Put the boot disk in your A: drive.
   B.  Restart your computer,  either by pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE,  by
       hitting your reset button,  or by turning it on.
   C.  Wait while your computer boots from the boot disk.
   D.  After a little while, your computer will stop and give you the A>
       prompt.
   E.  Now change to your hard disk by typing "C:".
   F.  Go into the Tyrian directory by typing "CD \TYRIAN".
   G.  Begin by typing "TYRIAN".

If you have DOS 6.0 or later
----------------------------

   Reboot your computer by pressing RESET or Ctrl-Alt-Del.  Wait for the
   message "Starting MS-DOS..." to come up.  Now press the [F5] key.

   This will cause DOS 6.0 to bypass all of your TSR's, memory managers,
   and other programs which normally occupy main memory.

   Now change into the TYRIAN directory and begin the game.

                       GENERAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
=============================================================================

Q: When I run Tyrian,  the game refuses to start and gives
   me the message "You do not have enough free memory."
A: To run Tyrian,  you'll need:
   
   * At least 220K(360K modem/network game) of free conventional memory
   * At least 2.5 Megs of other memory.
   
   Here's what you need to do:

   1. Make sure you have at least 4 megabytes of memory installed in your
   computer!  You'll need this much in order to have 2.5 Megs free.

   2. If you are trying to run Tyrian from Windows, completely exit
   Windows and try running it from DOS.

   3. If you are trying to run Tyrian from "DOSSHELL" or any other menu
   program,  please exit from the menu program.  Then, run Tyrian from the
   DOS prompt.  Menu programs often occupy enough memory that there won't
   be enough left for the game.

   4. If none of the above help, you can solve this problem quickly by
   "Booting your computer clean".  See above for details!

Q: When I run Tyrian,  the computer locks up or reboots.
A: Run SETUP and verify that your settings are correct. If you are
   not using a sound card, make sure that SETUP is set for "No Sound Card".
   If you are using a sound card, verify that your sound card has no 
   address, IRQ, or DMA conflicts with other peripherals in your system.
   If your sound card works properly with other games, you can assume that
   there are no conflicts.  However, if your sound card does not work with
   other games,  you have a conflict.  See your sound card manual for details
   on fixing this.

Q: Tyrian runs slowly on my 386 or 486 computer.  What can I do?
A: Your computer or VGA card isn't as fast as the game would like.

   You can speed up the game by running SETUP and changing the Detail 
   setting to a lower value.

Q: While playing, I get dumped back to DOS with an error message. 
A: This means that either (1) Tyrian is conflicting with your memory
   managers and TSR's,  or (2) you need more free memory to run Tyrian.
   Try booting clean and running Tyrian.

Q: I can't seem to get ANYTHING on the screen.  I type Tyrian and the system
   "hangs".  What now?
A: Make sure you have the system requirements mentioned earlier in the
   manual. If you do, you may have TSR's that conflict with Tyrian. Remove
   the TSR's and try running Tyrian with a "clean boot" from a DOS
   diskette.


=============================================================================
                            SOUND CARD NOTES
=============================================================================

   Since new models of sound cards are always being manufactured and revised,
   sometimes a new sound card will come out that's not compatible with
   Tyrian.  To determine whether you are having a sound-related conflict,
   try setting up Tyrian for "No Music" and "No Effects."  If Tyrian works
   without sound, but locks up with sound on, chances are that you are
   having a sound-related conflict.

   Here's how to contact the top sound card makers for information about
   sound card problems and obtaining the latest driver files.

Speeding up Net/Modem/BBS play
------------------------------

There are many factors that can cause Tyrian to run slowly over a network,
modem, or BBS.  The following is a list of suggestions to play Tyrian at a
reasonable speed.

Game options:
  Speed - Because some slowdown is inherent in Modem/Network games, you may
          need to turn you "Speed" setting up.
  Video Options - Turning detail levels down will also make gameplay faster.

Modem/BBS link:
  Make sure your init string turns OFF both Error Correction and Data
  Compression.  Consult your manual for details.


Modem/Net Problems
------------------

Q: Tyrian plays really slow over modem/BBS link.  How can I speed it up?
A: Some suggestions are listed above in the "Speeding up Net/Modem/BBS Play"
   section.  Some factors which may slow down the game that you cannot
   control are: line noise, the speed of your opponent's computer, your
   opponent's connection (baud rate and line noise on his/her end).

Q: Help!  I can't seem to connect with my friend by modem to play Tyrian.
A: Check to see that your init string is valid and each command in it is
   performing the desired function (turn off error correction, for example).
   Consult your manual for details regarding your init string.  Also try
   connecting at various baud rates.

Q: Net/Modem Tyrian wont recognize my modem because it's not using a standard
   IRQ.  What can I do?
A: Include the line:  -IRQ # (where "#" is the IRQ which your modem uses) in
   the Advanced Options section where you set up your modem for Tyrian.  Other
   Advanced options are listed in this document or by typing NETMODEM -? at
   the TYRIAN> prompt.
